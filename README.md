**Team NeuroBytes | University of Moratuwa**

## üîç Project Overview

**GlucoPal** is a **non-invasive, low-cost, portable device** for real-time blood glucose monitoring using **Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy** and **Photoplethysmography (PPG)**. The system addresses the global diabetes epidemic, particularly in regions like **Sri Lanka**, where **20% of adults** are diabetic or pre-diabetic‚Äîmany undiagnosed due to lack of screening tools.

**Goal:** Eliminate painful and costly finger-prick tests through a user-friendly device powered by optical sensing and AI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Finger Placement**: User places a finger on a 3D-printed sensor clip.
2. **Signal Acquisition**: A 940nm IR emitter/receiver captures PPG signals.
3. **Signal Processing**: ESP32 microcontroller amplifies, filters, and transmits data to a Raspberry Pi.
4. **Model Inference**: A trained **1D ResNet34 model** predicts glucose levels from the PPG data.
5. **Display Output**: Results are shown on an onboard OLED display.
